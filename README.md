Hi! I am a senior Computer Science student at Texas A&M Commerce. I enjoy all things math and computer science related. I am interested in Machine Learning,
more specifically Deep Learning. I am currently independently learning Keras and PyTorch. I am currently working on several projects, which I will eventually get around
to adding to this space. I am always looking for projects to expand my knowledge and understanding of the Machine Learning world. I can be reached at 
jlutz1@leomail.tamuc.edu.
